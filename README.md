# inat-insect-pin-labels

![<br>](labels.png)

An iPython notebook provides code for generating PDF pages of small labels for pinned insect specimens from data stored in
an iNaturalist project.

It was originally developed for my University of Guam entomology students who use an iNaturalist project (<http://www.inaturalist.org/projects/ag-bi-345-f15>) to catalog their insect collections.

Eventually, I would like to repackage this as a web app where students can print labels for a selected set of observations/specimens. Thinking about using a Django framework.
